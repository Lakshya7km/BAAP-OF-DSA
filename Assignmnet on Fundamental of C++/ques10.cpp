    cout<<++a;//value of the var incrementedd before it used 
  
}
//like above for a++ the value is incremented after it use means if a=5 after the output which is 5 if we print a agaiin it will print 6
//for ++a it will give us directed incremented value rather then storing it on the intializing variable
